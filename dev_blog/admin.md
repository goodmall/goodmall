三的定理 : [rule-of-three](https://blog.codinghorror.com/rule-of-three/)
>	Talking about duplication and reuse, don't try to make everything generic from the beginning. If you try, and it is used across the organization, it will cause friction, as a lot of people will want to contribute. Concentrate on your feature and specific usecases, before thinking about generic usage. The 'particular feature first over generic usage' strategy works far better. And don’t forget about the helpful ‘rule of three’ when thinking about extracting code.
